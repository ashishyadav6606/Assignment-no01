 Ans no 06=Indentation is used to define a block of code in python. Braces {} are used to define a block of code in most programming languages, like C, C++, and Java. But this indentation makes python unique among all programming languages.
Ans no 07Hash character(#) is used to comment the line in the Python program. Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code. The hash character should be placed before the line to be commented.
